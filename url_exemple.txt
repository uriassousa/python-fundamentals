Required Python Modules
Reading and writing files does not require loading an additional module, but accessing the file system functions (like handling directories) requires that we use a separate module. First, the os module has to be loaded. os is a Python module which belongs to the core part of the Python ecosystem. It is done using an import statement as follows:

import os
The os module contains most of the methods we'll need throughout this article. However, as you'll see later on, if you want to something more advanced, like create a temporary file for storing data, then we'll also be needing the tempfile module.

Detecting the Current Working Directory
Before we get in to creating/removing directories, let's see how to perform some other basic directory operations, like detecting the current working directory using the method getcwd(). This method will return a string containing the path of your working directory. Listing 1 shows how to integrate this method in a Python script.

Detecting the Current Working Directory
Before we get in to creating/removing directories, let's see how to perform some other basic directory operations, like detecting the current working directory using the method getcwd(). This method will return a string containing the path of your working directory. Listing 1 shows how to integrate this method in a Python script.

# import the os module
import os

# detect the current working directory and print it
path = os.getcwd()
print ("The current working directory is %s" % path)

The output should look something like this:

$ python3 cwd.py
The current working directory is /home/frank/
Furthermore, the os module contains the additional getcwdb() method. This one is similar to the getcwd() method but returns the path as a binary string, instead.

There are quite a few other directory operations not covered in this article, like checking if a file or directory exists. But for now we'll move on to the main purpose of this article.
